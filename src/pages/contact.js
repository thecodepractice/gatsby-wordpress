			<h3>Thanks For Reading my blog By thecodepractice.com </h3>
			Hey there! I'm Anju Batta. I believe you are here because you want to know something about me, huh? I'm not good at explaining me, but yea, I've tried my best. I'm a learner. Years down the lane, I aspire to architect solutions. I don't have the patience for positioning a "div" on the web-page, if you ignore that, with all the critical thinking and multi-tasking I boast of, you can count me for a full-stack developer. I'm obsessed with coding, but I believe in thinking and planning before writing the code. I go mad when code isn't aligned. I like keeping the code DRY. The amount of code I punch in is directly proportional to the coffee I consume. And a little truth: I cannot survive without google and stackoverflow. .
